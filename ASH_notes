I am using this site to convert the HOTELS csv to JSON:
http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm

Convert the event.json to lowercase so that we can compare to our database
which is all in lower case when we do a lookup!


Here is the production JSON feed from ASH:
http://test-apps.hematology.org/ash_alexa/api/session


Here is the program to download it:

JSON
Use Code Validator and download
